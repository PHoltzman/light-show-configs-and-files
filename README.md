# vixen-configs-and-light-show-files
This contains the core setup files we use for Vixen Lights as well as copies of our music and sequencing files for the Christmas light shows we do each year.

Please use these files to help you on your way to creating your own Christmas Light Show. Hundreds of cumulative horus of effort has gone into the music and sequencing for our various light shows and we hope that sharing everything will help lessen the learning curve for others.

If you find yourself using our sequences or music mashups, please consider giving BroomfieldLights.com a shout-out in whatever way is appropriate for your activity.
